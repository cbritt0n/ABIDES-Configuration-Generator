# ABIDES Configuration Generator v1.0.0 - Dependencies
# Production-ready configuration generator with minimal external dependencies

# ABIDES Framework Dependencies (required for generated configurations)
# Note: These are imported in generated files, not required for the generator itself
# numpy>=1.20.0        # Required by generated ABIDES configurations
# pandas>=1.3.0        # Required by generated ABIDES configurations  

# Core Generator Dependencies
# The generator itself has zero external dependencies beyond Python 3.8+ standard library

# Standard Library Modules Used (no installation required):
# - argparse: CLI argument parsing
# - os, sys: System utilities
# - re: Regular expressions for validation
# - logging: Professional logging
# - pathlib: Cross-platform file paths
# - datetime: Date and time handling
# - typing: Type hints for production quality
# - tkinter: GUI framework (optional, built-in with Python)

# Development Dependencies (uncomment for development/testing)
# pytest>=7.0.0
# black>=22.0.0  
# flake8>=5.0.0
# mypy>=0.991

# Future Enhancement Dependencies (for potential v2.1 features)
# typer>=0.7.0          # Enhanced CLI framework
# rich>=12.0.0          # Rich terminal output
# pydantic>=1.10.0      # Data validation
# jinja2>=3.0.0         # Template engine

# Production Deployment (uncomment if needed)
# docker>=5.0.0
# kubernetes>=24.0.0

# Note: The generator produces ABIDES configuration files that require:
# - ABIDES framework installation (abides-core, abides-markets)  
# - numpy, pandas (for the generated configurations)
# - Python 3.8+ with standard library

# Zero external dependencies design ensures:
# ✅ Easy installation and deployment
# ✅ Minimal security surface area  
# ✅ Maximum compatibility across environments
# ✅ Reduced maintenance overhead
