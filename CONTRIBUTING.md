- Performance benchmarks
- Cross-platform compatibility

## üîß Development Workflow

### Code Changes
1. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make your changes to `configgen.py`
3. Test your changes thoroughly:
   ```bash
   python comprehensive_test_v1.py
   make test
   ```
4. Update documentation as needed
5. Commit with descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add momentum-based market maker agent type"
   ```

### Testing Requirements
Before submitting a pull request:
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New functionality includes tests
- [ ] Syntax validation passes (`python -m py_compile configgen.py`)
- [ ] Documentation updated for new features
- [ ] Examples provided for new templates/agents

### Pull Request Process
1. Push your branch to your fork
2. Create a pull request with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Motivation and use case
   - Testing performed
   - Documentation updates
3. Address review feedback promptly
4. Ensure CI/CD checks pass
